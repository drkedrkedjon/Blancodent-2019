<p><em>What personal information do we collect? (How do we get them?)</em>
We will request the minimum necessary data to carry out the purposes indicated in the previous section, normally, name and surname, address, contact information to notify you of appointments, and in case you are interested in receiving information about our promotions, as well as contact information for this, like the email and the phone number to send them by whatsapp.</p>

<p>In addition, in relation to your Clinical History, all the data and health background that we must request by law.</p>

When data processing is imposed by a standard, this usually incorporates the period during which data must be treated or stored, so the Commercial Code establishes the obligation to keep the data for accounting and commercial purposes for six years, but There are certain assumptions such as the application of certain deductions that require the keeping of economic justifications for a longer period, sometimes up to fifteen years.</p>
